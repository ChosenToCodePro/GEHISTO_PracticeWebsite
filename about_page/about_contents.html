            We have compiled information related to the works of Antonio Pigafetta, a Nobleman<br>
            and a Scholar who had ventured with Magellan across the seas in search of spices.<br>
            This site includes information about The First Map of the Strait of Magellan of 1520, <br>
            Pigafetta’s account of the First Mass in the Philippines, and the Battle of Mactan, all <br>
            laid out in a modernized website using imagery inspired by the aesthetics of <br>
            skeuomorphism. Bask in the presence of a snapshot, a view in history that invites you <br>
            to know more of what you might not know. <br>

            <h1>About Pigafetta’s Journey</h1>
            <p>Tracing the voyage through three major events of 1521</p>
            <h1>The First Map of the Strait of Magellan (1520)</h1>
            <p>
                Pigafetta’s map depicted the Strait of Magellan—an essential, yet treacherous sea passage discovered during the first circumnavigation of the globe.<br>
                Although dangerous, it became a crucial route linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans before the Panama Canal existed.<br>
            </p>
            <h1>Pigafetta’s Account of the First Mass in the Philippines</h1>
            <p>
                The first Catholic Mass was held on March 31, 1521 in Limasawa, as documented by Antonio Pigafetta. Father Pedro de Valderrama<br>
                officiated the Mass, which was attended by local leaders and Magellan’s crew, marking the formal introduction of Christianity in the Philippines.<br>
            </p>
            <h1>The Battle of Mactan</h1>
            <p>
                On April 27, 1521, Lapulapu and his warriors successfully repelled Magellan’s forces in Mactan. Despite their advanced weapons, <br>
                the Spaniards were defeated due to local resistance and the terrain—an act recorded by Pigafetta that represents early Filipino bravery.<br>
