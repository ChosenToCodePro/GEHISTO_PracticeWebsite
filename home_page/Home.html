                <div class="hidden">
                    <p>The First Map of the Strait of Magellan of 1520</p>
                    <p>
                        The first circumnavigation of the globe was the voyage of 1519--22 by the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan (1480--1521), <br>
                        undertaken in the service of Spain. The only known first-hand account of the voyage is the journal by Venetian nobleman and <br>
                        scholar Antonio Pigafetta (circa 1480--1534). Four manuscript versions of Pigafetta's journal survive, three in French and one in Italian. <br>
                        Pigafetta also made 23 beautiful, hand-drawn color maps, a complete set of which accompanies each of the manuscripts. <br>
                        Shown here is Pigafetta's map of the Strait of Magellan, as reproduced in Carlo Amoretti's 1800 edition of the only Pigafetta manuscript in Italian. <br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Amoretti (1741--1816) was an Italian priest, writer, scholar, and scientist, who, as a conservator at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, <br>
                        discovered the manuscript, which was long thought to be lost. Amoretti published the Italian text with notes in 1800, and a French <br>
                        translation the following year. The map depicts the southern part of South America, including the Strait of Magellan, discovered on the voyage.<br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Pigafetta’s map depicted the Strait of Magellan—an essential, yet treacherous sea passage discovered during the first circumnavigation of the globe. <br>
                        Although dangerous, it became a crucial route linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans before the Panama Canal existed.<br>

            <h3>The First Mass<br></h3>
            <div class="hidden">
                <p>The First Mass in the Philippines<br></p>
                <p>
                    The first recorded Catholic Mass in the Philippines took place on March 31, 1521, Easter Sunday, on the island identified by Antonio Pigafetta<br>
                    as "Mazaua." Pigafetta, the chronicler of Ferdinand Magellan’s expedition, documented this historic event in his journal. <br>
                    According to his account, the Mass was officiated by Father Pedro de Valderrama and attended by <br>
                    Magellan, his crew, and local chieftains Rajah Kolambu and Rajah Siaiu.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The location of Mazaua has been a subject of historical debate. While some historians previously believed that the <br>
                    first Mass was held in Butuan, later studies confirmed that Limasawa in Southern Leyte was the actual site. <br>
                    A monograph by Fr. Miguel Bernad in 1981 corrected the misconception, aligning with William Henry Scott’s 1982 study,<br>
                    which further established Limasawa as the true location. The National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) <br>
                    has officially recognized Limasawa as the site of the first Mass.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Early accounts—mainly by friars relying on available writings and on tradition—reported the First Mass as being held in Butuan, <br>
                    Agusan del Norte, specifically on an island called Masao. The 1734 Murillo-Velarde map, for example, indicates the first <br>
                    land sighting as Surigao from where the expedition headed north to Dinagat and Limasawa, then south to Butuan, <br>
                    back north to Limasawa, from where they sailed along the west coast of Leyte, the Camotes Islands, and down to Sugbo and Mactan.<br>
                    In 1872, a marker was raised in Agusan, at the place where the First Mass was then believed to have been held. <br>
                    With changes in place names and in the course of the Agusan River, the marker’s location is now in the town of Magallanes, across the river from Butuan City.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) has adopted the recommendation of a panel of experts <br>
                    confirming that the 1521 Easter Sunday Mass took place in Limasawa, not in Butuan, as some historians had previously suggested.<br>

            <h3>Battle of Mactan</h3>

                <p>Battle of Mactan</p>
                <p>
                    The Diorama of the Battle of Mactan is a project to illustrate the real events of the battle in the educational format of <br>
                    what happened between the forces of Magellan and Lapu-Lapu on April 27, 1521. Both antagonists in this 16th-century <br>
                    drama have been long misunderstood by our fellow countrymen because of the long-standing biases, sometimes <br>
                    disinterest in historical narratives and mostly from lack of true, historically accurate books on this subject until <br>
                    the publication of the book entitled “Ferdinand Magellan. The Armada de Maluco and the European Discovery of the Philippines.” <br>
                    This book, published in 2016, by Dr. Danilo Madrid Gerona, is the most comprehensive narrative of the historical saga of <br>
                    Magellan that is based on primary sources found in Spain and Portugal.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Dr. Gerona has written a special narrative for Sulu Garden Foundation that describes the events of that momentous<br>
                    day on April 21, 1521 during the Battle of Mactan.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    During this day was the battle in which Magellan’s Conquistadores and Magellan’s Allies (Rajah Humabon and Rajah Zula) <br>
                    fought Rajah Lapu Lapu and his Mactan Allies. Because there was no written account of the battle from the point of <br>
                    view of Rajah Lapu Lapu's warriors, this narrative is mostly based on the records by Antonio Pigafetta, <br>
                    an Italian adventurer and chronicler, who joined Magellan’s expedition.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Battle of Mactan on April 27, 1521, was the first major resistance by Filipinos against foreign colonizers. <br>
                    Datu Lapulapu and his warriors successfully fought against the Spanish forces led by Ferdinand Magellan, <br>
                    who had superior weapons.
